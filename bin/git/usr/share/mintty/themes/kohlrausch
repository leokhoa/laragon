# "kohlrausch" colour theme for mintty

#
# This is a variant of the "helmholtz" theme that has been designed for use
# with a dark text colour and light background, by darkening the foreground
# variants of the normal colours and brightening the background ones.
#
# To level the colours, their luminance was calculated as follows:
# - Gamma-expand the sRGB components by dividing each by 255 and applying the
#   sRGB transfer function (which approximately means applying exponent 2.2).
# - Combine the components with formula Y = 0.2126 R + 0.7152 G + 0.0722 B.
# - Gamma-compress with the reverse transfer function (approximately: apply
#   exponent 1/2.2).

#
# The colours were then adjusted to achieve equal luminance. However, that does
# not actually yield colours with equal apparent brightness. This is due to the
# "Helmholtz-Kohlrausch effect", which means that some saturated colours appear
# brighter than others to the human eye. The theme is named after that.

#
# There doesn't appear to be a generally valid model for compensating for the
# effect, as it depends on observer, display device, and viewing environment.
# Hence, correction factors were determined experimentally, ranging from 1.0
# for yellow to 1.45 for red, and the colour components adjusted accordingly.
# Of course, that is a highly subjective process ...
